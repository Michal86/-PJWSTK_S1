/**
 * User: MichaÅ‚ Radzewicz
 * Project: (N Slider) "Puzzle Game" - it's my coursework using JavaFX for GUI.
 * User is allowed to:
 *  -> Add his Profile (Nick) to keep a track of his games.
 *  -> Pick a map to solve
 *  -> Choose difficulty from 3 to 5 (Meaning i.e.: Picking 3 program creates 3 by 3 square map)
 *  -> Check saved records [I used JSON file to save and load previous rankings]
 *
 *  Additionally:
 *      1. I implemented helper button [A* path finding algorithm] -> It still needs updates/rework
 *         as it's working slow for me (even with the Manhattan distance heuristic), and only found solutions for 3x3 puzzle game.
 *      2. TO_DO: add save/load Players profiles to FilesManager
